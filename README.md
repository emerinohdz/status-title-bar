Status Title Bar
================

Gnome-Shell extension that shows the current focused window's title in the
status panel when maximized. It replaces the current AppButton that shows the
current focused application's name by default. If the current focused window is
not maximized, then it falls back to showing the focused applications name.

Note
----

For best results, use the the extension
[Extend left box](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/51/extend-left-box).
